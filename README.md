We implement the stochastic algorithm for compression first introduced by Cannon et al. (2016) in *[A Markov Chain Algorithm for Compression in Self-Organizing Particle Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07991.pdf)*

### Acknowledgements

This project is based on work by the [SOPS Group](https://sops.engineering.asu.edu/).

We rebased from [RUC-Shende/programmable-particles](https://github.com/RUC-Shende/programmable-particles). The original front-end was written by [dbushta](https://github.com/dbushta) and [chri55](https://github.com/chri55), and [JesseTCS](https://github.com/JesseTCS) wrote the simulator for the Leader Election algorithm in the Amoebot model.
